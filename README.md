# StyleCopPlus.Analyzers

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/k8pfm3e0miaqrada/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sergey-rybalkin/stylecopplus-analyzers/branch/master)

This project is an implementation of StyleCop+ rules using the .NET Compiler Platform (Roslyn) as well as some 
additional refactorings and analyzers. Original project is available on 
[CodePlex](https://stylecopplus.codeplex.com/).

## Installation
This project is available as a NuGet package and VSIX extension. Currently Roslyn does not support loading 
refactorings from NuGet packages so you need to install VSIX extension in order to get full functionality.
